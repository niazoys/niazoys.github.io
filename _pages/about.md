I am a PhD candidate at <a href="https://qurai.amsterdam/">qurAI</a>, University of Amsterdam. Working under the supervision of  <a href="https://qurai.amsterdam/researcher/clarisa-sanchez/">Prof. Clarisa Sánchez</a> and <a href="https://ebekkers.github.io/">Prof. Erik Bekkers</a>, we investigate uncertainty-aware predictive deep learning models for treatment decision-making in neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) patients. 

Before that, I worked as a researcher in EU H2020 <a href="https://moore4medical.eu/">Moore4Medical</a> project, with the <a href="https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/research/department-advanced-computing-sciences">Department of Advanced Computing Sciences</a>, <a href="https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/"> Maastricht University </a> team. I was also a Research Associate at <a href="https://latim.univ-brest.fr/">laboratoire de traitement de l'information médicale (LaTIM)</a> , which is a medical image processing lab under 
the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research. At <a href="https://latim.univ-brest.fr/">LaTIM</a> I particularly worked with <a href="https://www.imt-atlantique.fr/en/person/pierre-henri-conze">Prof. Pierre-Henri CONZE </a>.

As of my education, I obtained my Erasmus+ Mundus Joint Master (EMJMD) in <a href="https://ipcv.eu/">Image Processing and Computer Vision (IPCV)</a> from three different universities across Europe and my B.Sc. from <a href="https://daffodilvarsity.edu.bd/department/cse">Department of Computer Science & Engineering</a>, <a href="https://daffodilvarsity.edu.bd/">Daffodil International University (DIU)</a>, Bangladesh.
